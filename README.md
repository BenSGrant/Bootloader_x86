# Bootloader
To run, make sure you have qemu installed on a Linux system
(it can be a VM, I used an Ubuntu 20.04 VM on top of a Windows 10 host)
and run the Makefile.

This bootloader is nothing fancy, it is the simplest it could be and the
only thing it does is write an X onto the screen after booting
